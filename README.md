Context Aware Searching which takes in a keyword (query) and outputs related keywords. Two models are used: N-gram model and Neural Embedding Network 

## Libraries required 
* NLTK, Tensorflow, Pandas, Scipy, Numpy, 

## Dataset used: 
* All the news dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news

## Usage for n-gram 
* Run ngram_search.py to form the probability distribution for 1-gram/2-gram model 
* Run main_search.py to use the n-gram models 

## Usage for Neural Embedding 
* Run neural_embedding_makedata.py to process the data 
* Run neural_embedding_model.py to use the train/use the model
